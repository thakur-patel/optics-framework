"""Beginner-facing onboarding output for the optics CLI.

Everything a newcomer sees on their first runs lives here: the welcome banner,
the first-run marker under ``~/.optics``, and the "now run:" block printed at
the end of project creation. Engineer B's CLI commands call these directly —
see ``quickstart.py`` for the guided flow that stitches them together.

The marker path is computed inside each function (not at import time) so that
tests can point ``HOME`` at a temporary directory.
