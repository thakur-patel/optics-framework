**Optics Framework** is a powerful, extensible no code test automation framework designed for **vision powered**, **data-driven testing** and **production app synthetic monitoring**. It enables seamless integration with intrusive action & detection drivers such as Appium / WebDriver as well as non-intrusive action drivers such as BLE mouse / keyboard and detection drivers such as video capture card and external web cams.

This framework was designed primarily for the following use cases:

1. Production app monitoring where access to USB debugging / developer mode and device screenshots is prohibited
2. Resilient self-healing test automation that rely on more than one element identifier and multiple fallbacks to ensure maximum recovery
3. Enable non-coders to build test automation scripts

## 🚀 Features

- **Vision powered detections:** UI object detections are powered by computer vision and not just on XPath elements.
- **No code automation:** No knowledge of programming languages or access to IDE needed to build automations scripts
- **Supports non-intrusive action drivers:** Non-intrusive action drivers such as BLE mouse and keyboard are supported
- **Data-Driven Testing (DDT):** Execute test cases dynamically with multiple datasets, enabling parameterized testing and iterative execution.
- **Extensible & Scalable:** Easily add new keywords and modules without any hassle.
- **AI Integration:** Choose which AI models to use for object recognition and OCR.
- **Self-healing capability:** Configure multiple drivers, screen capture methods, and detection techniques with priority-based execution. If a primary method fails, the system automatically switches to the next available method in the defined hierarchy
