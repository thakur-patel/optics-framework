# MCP Usage (`optics mcp`)

`optics mcp` runs a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server that exposes the optics-framework keyword engine to an LLM client
(Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, …). The model starts a device/browser
session, runs automation keywords as **tools**, and observes device state through
**resources** — driving a live target the way `optics live` does, but under agent
control.

The surface is deliberately small: the keyword tools plus a few resources. There
are **no record/save/replay tools** — a capable agent already knows the steps it
ran, so to turn a session into a reusable suite it authors an optics CSV project
itself (the `optics://project-format` resource documents the exact layout) and
runs it with `optics execute`. The MCP layer stays driver- and device-agnostic:
it never shells out to `adb` or assumes a device type; it only makes calls to the
driver server you point `start_session` at.

It reuses the in-process keyword machinery from the REST server
(`optics serve`), so whatever driver and element sources optics already supports
work here too. The driver is chosen at runtime via the `start_session` tool —
nothing is hard-coded.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** and optics-framework installed.
- **A driver target** that optics can reach — e.g. a local
  [Appium](https://appium.io) server with a connected device/emulator, or a
  remote Appium hub. You provide its URL and capabilities to `start_session`.
- An MCP-capable client (Claude Desktop/Code, Cursor, or the `fastmcp` Python
  client for scripting).
- *(Optional)* extras for richer element location: text detection
  (`googlevision`) and image detection (`templatematch`) require their own
  credentials/config, exactly as in a normal optics `config.yaml`.

## 2. Install

The MCP server depends on [`fastmcp`](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp),
shipped as an **optional extra**:

```bash
pip install 'optics-framework[mcp]'
# from source:
poetry install --extras mcp
```

If the extra is missing, `optics mcp` exits with a clear message telling you to
install it — the rest of the CLI is unaffected.

## 3. Run the server

```bash
# stdio transport (default) — for local clients that spawn the process
optics mcp

# HTTP transport — for networked / multi-client use
optics mcp --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8090
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--transport` | `stdio` | `stdio` (local clients) or `http` |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | bind host (http only) |
| `--port` | `8090` | bind port (http only) |

### Docker

Containerized MCP runs **HTTP transport** bound to `0.0.0.0:8090` (stdio is for
local clients that spawn the process). Images live under `Docker/mcp/` and
install the `[mcp]` extra (`fastmcp`).

**Docker Compose** (from the repo root):

```bash
# Production image (PyPI) — host port 8090
docker compose -f Docker/docker-compose.yml up --build mcp

# Development image (local .whl) — host port 8091
docker compose -f Docker/docker-compose.yml up --build mcp-dev
```

**Standalone build/run:**

```bash
docker build -f Docker/mcp/prod/Dockerfile -t optics-mcp-prod .
docker run -d -p 8090:8090 --name optics-mcp-prod optics-mcp-prod
```

Connect your MCP client to the container:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optics": { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8090/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Use port **8091** for the `mcp-dev` compose service. When `start_session`
targets Appium on the host, set `"url": "http://host.docker.internal:4723"`.
See [`Docker/deployment.md`](../../Docker/deployment.md) for vision-backend
build args, Google Vision credential mounts, and dev-wheel builds.

## 4. Connect an MCP client

**stdio** — the client launches the server itself. Add to your client's MCP
config (e.g. Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`, or Claude Code
`.mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optics": {
      "command": "optics",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

If `optics` isn't on the client's `PATH`, use the absolute path (e.g.
`/path/to/.venv/bin/optics`) or `"command": "python", "args": ["-m",
"optics_framework.helper.cli", "mcp"]`.

**HTTP** — start the server yourself (`optics mcp --transport http`) and point
the client at the URL:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "optics": { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8090/mcp" }
  }
}
```

## 5. The expected journey

1. **`start_session`** — open a session against your driver. Returns
   `{ "session_id", "driver_id" }`. The target app is launched automatically.
   Capture the `session_id`; **every** other tool and resource needs it.
   `elements_sources` **defaults per driver** (appium →
   `appium_find_element`/`appium_page_source`/`appium_screenshot`; selenium and
   playwright analogous), so `start_session` with just a `driver` works. The device
   is identified through `capabilities` (e.g. `deviceName`/`udid`) — the MCP needs
   no `adb` of its own.
2. **Observe** — call `screenshot`, read `optics://session/{session_id}/source`,
   or call `get_interactive_elements` for tappable elements with their `bounds`.
   These work the same across drivers via the session's own element sources.
3. **Act** — call keyword tools (`press_element`, `enter_text`, `swipe`,
   `assert_presence`, …) with the `session_id`. **Target elements by locator**
   (`xpath=`/`text=`/an id/an image) with `press_element`; when there is no stable
   locator, `detect_and_press` taps by the visible text/label, and otherwise use
   the exact `bounds` from `get_interactive_elements`. Do not tap raw pixel
   coordinates guessed off a screenshot; those misfire.
4. **Build a reusable suite** — see below.
5. **`terminate_session`** — release the driver when done.

### Build a reusable suite (author it — there's no save tool)

The MCP has no recording/save/replay tools on purpose: you already know the
keywords you called and their args, so you can author an optics project directly.

1. Read the **`optics://project-format`** resource — it documents the CSV layout
   (`test_cases/`, `modules/`, `test_data/elements.csv`, `config.yaml`), how
   modules reference `${variables}`, and the escaping rules.
2. Write those files (the keyword *display names* come from the `optics://keywords`
   catalog). Parameterize by putting run-specific values in `elements.csv` and
   referencing them as `${name}`, so "set alarm to 22:00" becomes a reusable
   `${time}`. A whole cell must be exactly `${name}` — the runner substitutes
   whole values only, not `${name}` inside a larger string.
3. For loops, branching, computed values or API calls in a suite, author the
   control-flow keywords (`Run Loop`, `Condition`, `Evaluate`, `Invoke Api`, …)
   into the modules — they run under `optics execute`. Live, you drive that logic
   yourself; they are in the `optics://keywords` catalog but are not one-shot MCP
   tools because they need the runner's module/data context.
4. Run it with the CLI: `optics execute <folder>` (results land in
   `execution_output/`). To replay interactively instead, just call the keyword
   tools again in sequence — the agent is the runner.

### `start_session` arguments

| Arg | Type | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| `driver` | str | driver name, e.g. `"appium"` (default) |
| `url` | str | driver/hub URL (e.g. local `http://127.0.0.1:4723` or a remote hub) |
| `capabilities` | object | driver capabilities (platform, device, app, auth…) |
| `elements_sources` | list[str] | element sources to enable; **optional** — defaults to the driver's canonical set (see §8) |
| `text_detection` | list[str] | optional OCR sources (e.g. `["googlevision"]`) |
| `image_detection` | list[str] | optional template sources (e.g. `["templatematch"]`) |
| `project_path` | str | optional project folder (loads bundled templates) |
| `ai_self_heal` | bool | optional per-session override of the server's `OPTICS_AI_SELF_HEAL` default (see below) |
| `llm_provider` | str | optional per-session override of the server's `OPTICS_LLM_PROVIDER` default (see below) |
| `llm_model` | str | optional per-session override of the server's `OPTICS_LLM_MODEL` default (see below) |

**Example — local Appium + Android emulator:**

```json
{
  "driver": "appium",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:4723",
  "capabilities": {
    "platformName": "Android",
    "appium:automationName": "UiAutomator2",
    "appium:deviceName": "emulator-5554",
    "appium:appPackage": "com.android.settings",
    "appium:appActivity": ".Settings"
  },
  "elements_sources": ["appium_find_element", "appium_page_source", "appium_screenshot"]
}
```

Omit `appPackage`/`appActivity` to attach to whatever is already on screen. For
a remote/managed hub, set `url` to the hub and include any hub-specific
capabilities (auth token, device id) just as you would in `config.yaml`.

### AI self-heal

Self-heal has two layers. Whoever starts `optics mcp` (or `optics serve`) can
set a **server-level default** once via environment variables, so a client
that's already integrated inherits it with no `start_session` changes:

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `OPTICS_AI_SELF_HEAL` | off | `true`/`1`/`yes`/`on` (case-insensitive) enables it |
| `OPTICS_LLM_PROVIDER` | `gemini` | which `llm_models` entry to enable |
| `OPTICS_LLM_MODEL` | provider default | optional model name override |

Because a single `serve`/`mcp` process is multi-tenant, each of these is also a
**per-session override** on `start_session`: `ai_self_heal`, `llm_provider`, and
`llm_model`. A per-session value always wins over the matching env-var default,
so a caller can opt in/out and pick its own model without being locked to the
operator's choice; anything left unset falls back to the env default (and then to
`gemini`). LLM credentials (e.g. `GOOGLE_API_KEY`/`GEMINI_API_KEY` for Gemini)
always come from the provider's own environment variables — never through
`start_session` — so choosing a provider/model per session exposes no secrets.

When self-heal recovers a keyword, the call still succeeds, and the result carries
the recovery so a client can learn *how* it was fixed:

```json
{
  "result": null,
  "healed": true,
  "heal_summary": "AI self-heal recovered 'press_element' after 2 steps: scroll down; press_element Login",
  "suggested_steps": [
    { "keyword": "scroll", "params": ["down"] },
    { "keyword": "press_element", "params": ["Login"] }
  ]
}
```

`suggested_steps` is the clean, replayable recovery sequence — only the steps that
actually worked, curated to the minimal set that reproduces the goal. A platform can
persist these to replace the failing step, so the next run passes without needing
self-heal. `optics serve`'s `POST /v1/sessions/{session_id}/action` returns the same
shape under `data`. Un-healed calls return the bare result, unchanged.

### Keyword parameters are strings

Every keyword tool takes `session_id` plus that keyword's parameters, and all
parameters are typed as **strings** — pass `"2"`, not `2`. Element arguments
accept the same locators optics uses elsewhere: `xpath=…`, `text=…`, `css=…`, an
`id`, or an image template name.

## 6. Tools reference

`start_session`, `terminate_session`, and `screenshot` are purpose-built; every
other tool is an optics keyword auto-exposed from `ActionKeyword` /
`AppManagement` / `Verifier`. Representative set:

- **Session/app:** `start_session`, `terminate_session`, `launch_app`,
  `launch_other_app`, `close_and_terminate_app`, `get_app_version`,
  `get_driver_session_id`.
- **Interact:** `press_element`, `press_by_coordinates`, `press_by_percentage`,
  `press_keycode`, `enter_text`, `enter_number`, `clear_element_text`,
  `select_dropdown_option`, `detect_and_press`.
- **Gestures/scroll:** `swipe`, `swipe_by_percentage`, `swipe_from_element`,
  `swipe_until_element_appears`, `scroll`, `scroll_from_element`,
  `scroll_until_element_appears`.
- **Observe/verify:** `screenshot` (rendered image), `get_text`,
  `get_interactive_elements` (accepts `filter_config`, e.g. `"buttons"`),
  `is_element`, `assert_presence`, `assert_equality`, `validate_element`,
  `validate_screen`.
- **Misc:** `sleep`, `execute_script`.

The full machine-readable catalog (every keyword, its params and docs) is the
`optics://keywords` resource.

`screenshot` returns a rendered `image/png` your client can display inline —
prefer it over the screenshot resource when you want to *see* the screen.

Besides the reflected keywords, only three tools are purpose-built:
`start_session`, `terminate_session`, and `screenshot`. There are intentionally
**no** recording, suite-CRUD, replay, device-discovery, or `doctor` tools — an
agent composes those from the keyword tools plus the `optics://project-format`
knowledge (see §5). `start_session` supplies the one non-obvious convenience: a
per-driver `elements_sources` default so the call just works.

## 7. Resources reference

| URI | Content |
|-----|---------|
| `optics://keywords` | full keyword catalog (name, slug, description, params) |
| `optics://project-format` | how optics stores a suite (CSV layout + `${var}`), so you can author one |
| `optics://session/{session_id}/screenshot` | screen as raw PNG bytes |
| `optics://session/{session_id}/source` | page source / UI hierarchy |
| `optics://session/{session_id}/elements` | interactive elements (unfiltered) |
| `optics://session/{session_id}/screen_elements` | captured screen elements |

`get_interactive_elements` is available **both** as a resource (unfiltered) and
as a tool (so the model can pass `filter_config`).

> The screenshot **resource** delivers raw PNG bytes with a generic
> `application/octet-stream` mime (a limitation of templated MCP resources). For
> an image your client renders as a picture, use the **`screenshot` tool**.

## 8. Element sources decide what works

The keywords you can use depend on which `elements_sources` (and detection
sources) you enable in `start_session` — same rules as a normal optics project.
When you omit `elements_sources`, `start_session` enables the driver's canonical
trio automatically (appium → `appium_find_element`/`appium_page_source`/
`appium_screenshot`); pass the argument only to narrow or extend that. An
explicit **empty** list is passed through and disables element sources entirely
(the session then fails to start) — omit the argument for the defaults:

| Capability | Needs |
|------------|-------|
| Locate by `xpath` / `text` / `id`, tap, type | `appium_find_element` |
| Screenshots & image-based location | `appium_screenshot` |
| Page source, `get_interactive_elements`, source-based extraction | `appium_page_source` |
| OCR / locate visible text on screen | a `text_detection` source (e.g. `googlevision`) |
| Image template matching | an `image_detection` source (e.g. `templatematch`) |

If you enable only `appium_find_element` + `appium_screenshot` and then call
`get_interactive_elements`, optics raises
`E0202: No interactive elements retrieved using available strategies` — that's
expected; enable `appium_page_source` (or a vision source) for that path.

## 9. Troubleshooting

- **First `start_session` is slow against a remote hub** (~30–60 s to allocate
  and launch). Give your client a generous timeout (the `fastmcp` Python client
  takes `Client(url, timeout=180)`).
- **`No module named 'fastmcp'` / "mcp extra required"** — install
  `optics-framework[mcp]`.
- **Sessions aren't shared with `optics serve` / `optics live`.** Each is a
  separate process with its own in-memory session store. Always `start_session`
  in this server before using a keyword tool; you cannot attach to a session
  created elsewhere.
- **Device busy / already allocated** — if your hub reports the device as busy,
  free it through your device-orchestration API, then retry `start_session`.
- **`get_interactive_elements` / `source` errors** — usually a missing element
  source; see §8.
- **Errors surface as MCP tool errors.** An optics failure (element not found,
  bad config, driver error) comes back as a `ToolError` carrying the optics
  error code/message, so the model can read and react to it.
- **`start_session` failed with "Element source configuration must be set".** You
  passed an explicit empty `elements_sources`, or the driver name doesn't match
  any installed element-source modules (e.g. a typo — check the name against
  §8). Omit `elements_sources` to get the driver defaults, or name the sources
  per §8.
- **Where do suites live?** Wherever you write them — the MCP has no workspace of
  its own. Author the CSV project (see `optics://project-format`) at a path you
  choose and run it with `optics execute`.
- **Setup errors (device unreachable, driver not running).** The MCP only talks to
  the driver server at the `url` you pass; make sure that server is up and can see
  the device (for Appium+Android that means its host has the Android SDK — the MCP
  itself needs none). `optics doctor` on that host diagnoses the toolchain.

## 10. How it works (pointer)

`optics mcp` is a thin in-process wrapper over `common/expose_api.py`. It reflects
the API keyword classes into typed tools and routes execution through the same
`execute_keyword` path the REST server uses; read-only observers become resources.
The only hand-written additions are the `start_session`/`terminate_session`/
`screenshot` lifecycle tools, the per-driver `elements_sources` default, and the
`optics://project-format` knowledge resource — no recording/suite/device tooling.
See `optics_framework/helper/mcp_server.py` and the "MCP server journey" section of
`CLAUDE.md` for the internals.
