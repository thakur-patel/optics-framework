## 1. Stateless API Layer

**Priority**: High | **Difficulty**: Advanced

### Current State

The API layer maintains state in `SessionManager` which stores sessions in memory. Sessions cannot be migrated between instances, making it difficult to scale horizontally or recover from instance failures.

### Goal

Make the API layer stateless so sessions can be migrated/moved from one instance to another without losing context. This enables:

- Horizontal scaling of API instances
- Session recovery after instance failures
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Zero-downtime deployments

### Key Areas

#### Session Storage

**Current**: Sessions stored in-memory only (`optics_framework/common/session_manager.py`)

**Needed**:

- External session storage (database, Redis, etc.)
- Session serialization/deserialization
- Session state export/import functionality

#### Session Context

**Current**: Session contains driver instances, element sources, vision models that cannot be serialized

**Needed**:

- Serialize all session state (configuration, driver state, element sources, vision models)
- Reconstruct session from serialized state
- Handle driver reconnection on migration
- Store driver session IDs and connection details

#### API Endpoints

**New Endpoints Needed**:

- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/export` - Export session state as JSON
- `POST /v1/sessions/import` - Import session state and recreate session
- `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/migrate` - Migrate session to another instance

### Files to Modify

- `optics_framework/common/session_manager.py` - Add serialization support
- `optics_framework/common/expose_api.py` - Add migration endpoints
- `optics_framework/common/models.py` - Add session state models (Pydantic)
- `optics_framework/common/optics_builder.py` - Support session reconstruction

## 2. Parallel Strategy Execution

**Priority**: High | **Difficulty**: Advanced

### Current State

Strategies are currently executed **sequentially** (one after another) in a fallback chain. When locating an element, the framework tries Strategy 1, waits for it to complete (success or failure), then tries Strategy 2, and so on. This sequential approach, while reliable, is slower than necessary because:

1. **Independent strategies wait unnecessarily**: Many strategies can run simultaneously since they don't depend on each other
2. **Total execution time is sum of all strategies**: If Strategy 1 takes 2s and Strategy 2 takes 3s, total time is 5s even if Strategy 2 could succeed immediately
3. **Resource underutilization**: CPU, I/O, and network resources are idle while waiting for sequential execution

**Example of Current Sequential Flow**:

```python
# Current: Sequential execution
1. Try XPathStrategy.find_element() → Wait 2s → Fail
2. Try TextElementStrategy.find_element() → Wait 1s → Fail
3. Try TextDetectionStrategy.find_element() → Wait 3s → Success
# Total time: 6 seconds
```

### Goal

Implement **parallel strategy execution** where multiple independent strategies run simultaneously, significantly reducing element location time while maintaining the same reliability and fallback behavior.

**Benefits**:

- **Faster element location**: Strategies execute concurrently, returning the first successful result
- **Better resource utilization**: CPU, I/O, and network resources used efficiently
- **Improved user experience**: Tests execute faster, especially with multiple fallback strategies
- **Maintains reliability**: Still supports fallback, but optimizes for the common case

**Example of Desired Parallel Flow**:

```python
# Desired: Parallel execution
1. Start XPathStrategy.find_element() → (runs in background)
2. Start TextElementStrategy.find_element() → (runs in background)
3. Start TextDetectionStrategy.find_element() → (runs in background)
4. First successful result returns → Total time: ~3 seconds (longest strategy)
```

### Execution Semantics

**Critical Requirement**: Only one strategy should execute the final keyword/action. Once a strategy successfully performs the keyword, all remaining strategies must be immediately aborted.

**Execution Rules**:

1. **Parallel Location Phase**: Multiple strategies run in parallel to locate the element
   - All strategies attempt to find the element simultaneously
   - First successful location result is selected
   - Remaining location attempts are cancelled/aborted

2. **Single Action Execution**: Only the winning strategy executes the keyword/action
   - The strategy that successfully located the element proceeds to execute the action
   - Other strategies are aborted before they can execute any actions
   - This prevents duplicate actions (e.g., clicking the same button twice)

3. **Fallback Behavior**: If the selected strategy fails to execute the keyword
   - Abort the failed strategy
   - Move to the next successful location result (if available)
   - If no other strategies succeeded in location, try the next strategy in sequence

**Example Flow**:

```python
# Parallel location phase
strategy1_result = await XPathStrategy.locate(element)      # Success: found element
strategy2_result = await TextStrategy.locate(element)      # Success: found element
strategy3_result = await OCRStrategy.locate(element)       # Still running...

# Strategy 1 wins (first success)
if strategy1_result:
    # Abort strategy 2 and 3 immediately
    abort_strategy(strategy2)
    abort_strategy(strategy3)

    # Only strategy 1 executes the keyword
    try:
        await strategy1.execute_keyword("press_element", strategy1_result)
        return success  # Done! No other strategies execute
    except Exception:
        # Strategy 1 failed to execute, try strategy 2
        abort_strategy(strategy1)
        await strategy2.execute_keyword("press_element", strategy2_result)
        return success
```

**Implementation Requirements**:

- **Cancellation Tokens**: Use `asyncio.CancelledError` or cancellation tokens to abort strategies
- **Early Exit**: Return immediately when first strategy succeeds
- **Resource Cleanup**: Properly clean up aborted strategies (close connections, release locks)
- **Error Handling**: Handle cancellation gracefully without side effects

### Key Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: XPath with Parallel Coordinate Discovery

**Current Behavior**:

When given an XPath, the framework:
1. Tries `find_element()` using the XPath directly
2. If that fails, tries other strategies sequentially

**Desired Parallel Behavior**:

When given an XPath, simultaneously:

1. **Primary path**: Execute `find_element()` using the XPath directly
2. **Parallel path**: Search page source to find the XPath and extract coordinates
3. **Fallback path**: If XPath is not accessible, use coordinates from page source

**Implementation Flow**:

```python
# Parallel execution
async def locate_with_xpath(element: str):
    tasks = [
        # Task 1: Direct findElement
        find_element_direct(element),

        # Task 2: Parse page source for XPath and get coordinates
        parse_page_source_for_coordinates(element),

        # Task 3: Alternative XPath variations
        try_xpath_variations(element)
    ]

    # Return first successful result
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    return first_successful_result(results)
```

#### Scenario 2: Text with Parallel XPath Discovery and OCR

**Current Behavior**:

When given text, the framework:
1. Tries text-based element location
2. If that fails, tries OCR sequentially
3. If that fails, tries other strategies

**Desired Parallel Behavior**:

When given text, simultaneously:

1. **Path A**: Search page source to find text and convert to XPath, then execute `find_element()`
2. **Path B**: Capture screenshot and use OCR/text detection to find coordinates
3. **Path C**: Try direct text matching in element source

**Implementation Flow**:

```python
# Parallel execution for text
async def locate_with_text(text: str):
    tasks = [
        # Task 1: Page source → XPath → findElement
        page_source_to_xpath_to_find_element(text),

        # Task 2: Screenshot → OCR → Coordinates
        screenshot_ocr_to_coordinates(text),

        # Task 3: Direct text element location
        direct_text_element_location(text)
    ]

    # Return first successful result
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    return first_successful_result(results)
```

#### Scenario 3: Image Template with Parallel Detection Methods

**Current Behavior**:

When given an image template, tries image detection strategies sequentially.

**Desired Parallel Behavior**:

Simultaneously:
1. Template matching (OpenCV)
2. Remote OIR service
3. Alternative image detection models

### Implementation Approach

#### Architecture Changes

**1. Strategy Execution Model**

Convert from sequential to parallel execution with abort capability:

```python
# Current: Sequential
class StrategyManager:
    def locate(self, element: str):
        for strategy in self.strategies:
            result = strategy.locate(element)  # Blocks here
            if result:
                return result
        raise ElementNotFoundError()

# Desired: Parallel with abort
class StrategyManager:
    async def locate(self, element: str):
        # Create tasks with cancellation support
        tasks = {
            strategy: asyncio.create_task(strategy.locate_async(element))
            for strategy in self.strategies
        }

        # Wait for first success, then abort others
        for strategy, task in tasks.items():
            try:
                result = await task
                if result:
                    # Abort all remaining tasks
                    for other_strategy, other_task in tasks.items():
                        if other_strategy != strategy and not other_task.done():
                            other_task.cancel()
                    return result
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                continue

        raise ElementNotFoundError()
```

**2. Strategy Interface Updates**

Make strategies async-compatible:

```python
# Current
class LocatorStrategy(ABC):
    def locate(self, element: str, index: int = 0):
        # Synchronous implementation
        pass

# Desired
class LocatorStrategy(ABC):
    async def locate_async(self, element: str, index: int = 0):
        # Asynchronous implementation
        pass

    def locate(self, element: str, index: int = 0):
        # Synchronous wrapper for backward compatibility
        return run_async(self.locate_async(element, index))
```

**3. Parallel Execution Groups with Abort**

Group strategies that can run in parallel with abort capability:

```python
class ParallelStrategyGroup:
    """Groups strategies that can execute in parallel"""

    def __init__(self, strategies: List[LocatorStrategy]):
        self.strategies = strategies
        self.priority = min(s.priority for s in strategies)

    async def execute_parallel(self, element: str):
        """Execute all strategies in parallel, return first success, abort others"""
        # Create cancellable tasks
        tasks = {
            strategy: asyncio.create_task(strategy.locate_async(element))
            for strategy in self.strategies
        }

        # Wait for first success
        for strategy, task in tasks.items():
            try:
                result = await task
                if result:
                    # Abort all remaining tasks
                    self._abort_remaining(tasks, strategy)
                    return result
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                continue

        return None

    def _abort_remaining(self, tasks: dict, winner: LocatorStrategy):
        """Cancel all tasks except the winner"""
        for strategy, task in tasks.items():
            if strategy != winner and not task.done():
                task.cancel()
```

**4. Dependency Management**

Identify which strategies can run in parallel vs. which must be sequential:

```python
class StrategyDependencyGraph:
    """Manages strategy dependencies and parallel execution"""

    def can_run_parallel(self, strategy1: LocatorStrategy, strategy2: LocatorStrategy) -> bool:
        """Check if two strategies can run in parallel"""
        # Strategies can run in parallel if:
        # 1. They don't modify shared state
        # 2. They don't depend on each other's results
        # 3. They use different resources (e.g., page source vs screenshot)
        return (
            not strategy1.modifies_shared_state() and
            not strategy2.modifies_shared_state() and
            strategy1.resource_type() != strategy2.resource_type()
        )
```

#### Specific Implementation Patterns

**Pattern 1: XPath with Coordinate Discovery**

```python
async def locate_xpath_parallel(element: str):
    """Locate element by XPath with parallel coordinate discovery"""

    async def direct_find():
        """Direct findElement using XPath"""
        return await element_source.locate(element)

    async def page_source_coords():
        """Parse page source to find XPath and get coordinates"""
        page_source, _ = await element_source.get_page_source()
        xpath_node = parse_xpath_from_page_source(page_source, element)
        if xpath_node:
            return get_coordinates_from_node(xpath_node)
        return None

    # Execute both in parallel
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        direct_find(),
        page_source_coords(),
        return_exceptions=True
    )

    # Prefer direct find, fallback to coordinates
    if results[0] and not isinstance(results[0], Exception):
        return results[0]
    if results[1] and not isinstance(results[1], Exception):
        return results[1]
    raise ElementNotFoundError()
```

**Pattern 2: Text with Multi-Path Discovery**

```python
async def locate_text_parallel(text: str):
    """Locate element by text with parallel multi-path discovery"""

    async def page_source_path():
        """Page source → Find text → Convert to XPath → findElement"""
        page_source, _ = await element_source.get_page_source()
        xpath = find_text_in_page_source(page_source, text)
        if xpath:
            return await element_source.locate(xpath)
        return None

    async def screenshot_ocr_path():
        """Screenshot → OCR → Find coordinates"""
        screenshot = await element_source.capture()
        text_locations = await text_detection.find_element(screenshot, text)
        if text_locations:
            return text_locations[0]  # Return first match
        return None

    async def direct_text_path():
        """Direct text element location"""
        return await element_source.locate_by_text(text)

    # Execute all three paths in parallel
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        page_source_path(),
        screenshot_ocr_path(),
        direct_text_path(),
        return_exceptions=True
    )

    # Return first successful result
    for result in results:
        if result and not isinstance(result, Exception):
            return result
    raise ElementNotFoundError()
```

**Pattern 3: Resource-Aware Parallel Execution**

```python
class ResourceAwareStrategyExecutor:
    """Executes strategies in parallel while managing resources"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.page_source_lock = asyncio.Lock()
        self.screenshot_lock = asyncio.Lock()
        self.driver_lock = asyncio.Lock()

    async def execute_parallel(self, strategies: List[LocatorStrategy], element: str):
        """Execute strategies in parallel with resource management"""

        # Group strategies by resource type
        page_source_strategies = [s for s in strategies if s.uses_page_source()]
        screenshot_strategies = [s for s in strategies if s.uses_screenshot()]
        driver_strategies = [s for s in strategies if s.uses_driver()]

        # Execute groups in parallel, but serialize within groups if needed
        tasks = []

        if page_source_strategies:
            tasks.append(self._execute_with_lock(
                page_source_strategies, element, self.page_source_lock
            ))

        if screenshot_strategies:
            tasks.append(self._execute_with_lock(
                screenshot_strategies, element, self.screenshot_lock
            ))

        if driver_strategies:
            tasks.append(self._execute_with_lock(
                driver_strategies, element, self.driver_lock
            ))

        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        return first_successful_result(results)
```

### Key Implementation Areas

- [Execution Architecture](../architecture/execution.md)

### Challenges and Considerations

#### Challenge 1: Resource Conflicts

**Problem**: Multiple strategies accessing the same resource (driver, page source) simultaneously

**Solution**:
- Use asyncio locks for shared resources
- Group strategies by resource type
- Serialize access to shared resources

#### Challenge 2: Backward Compatibility

**Problem**: Existing code expects synchronous strategy execution

**Solution**:
- Maintain sync wrappers for async methods
- Use `run_async()` utility for compatibility
- Gradual migration path

#### Challenge 3: Error Handling

**Problem**: Multiple strategies may fail in parallel

**Solution**:
- Aggregate all exceptions
- Return most informative error
- Log all strategy attempts

#### Challenge 4: Performance Tuning

**Problem**: Too many parallel tasks may degrade performance

**Solution**:
- Configurable max parallel strategies
- Resource-aware task scheduling
- Monitor and optimize based on metrics

#### Challenge 5: Ensuring Single Action Execution

**Problem**: Multiple strategies might try to execute the same keyword/action

**Solution**:
- Implement strict abort mechanism when first strategy succeeds
- Use cancellation tokens to immediately stop remaining strategies
- Only allow the winning strategy to proceed to action execution
- Add validation to prevent duplicate actions
- Implement proper cleanup for aborted strategies

## 3. Flexible Driver-Specific Strategies

**Priority**: High | **Difficulty**: Intermediate

### Current State

Strategies are generic and work across all drivers. Driver-specific capabilities (Playwright roles, CSS selectors) are not leveraged, limiting the framework's ability to use the best features of each driver.

### Goal

Enable custom strategies that are specific to individual drivers, allowing each driver to expose its unique capabilities while maintaining the fallback mechanism.

### Key Areas

#### Playwright-Specific Strategies

Playwright provides powerful locator methods that are not currently used:

- `get_by_role()` - Locate by ARIA role (button, textbox, etc.)
- `get_by_test_id()` - Locate by test ID attribute
- `get_by_label()` - Locate by associated label
- `get_by_placeholder()` - Locate by placeholder text
- `get_by_text()` - Locate by visible text
- `get_by_title()` - Locate by title attribute
- `get_by_alt_text()` - Locate by alt text (for images)

**Example**:

```python
# Current: Generic text strategy
element = "Submit Button"

# With Playwright role strategy:
element = "role:button[name='Submit']"
```

#### Selenium/Playwright CSS Strategies

Currently only XPath is supported. CSS selectors are more performant and readable:

- CSS selector support (not just XPath)
- CSS pseudo-selectors (`:first-child`, `:nth-of-type`, etc.)
- CSS attribute selectors (`[data-testid="submit"]`)

#### Appium-Specific Strategies

- UI Automator selectors (Android)
- iOS predicate strings
- Accessibility ID strategies
- Class name strategies

#### Strategy Registration

**Needed**:

- Driver-specific strategy factory
- Strategy priority per driver
- Dynamic strategy discovery mechanism
- Strategy registration API for drivers

### Files to Modify

- `optics_framework/common/strategies.py` - Add driver-specific strategy support
- `optics_framework/engines/drivers/playwright.py` - Add Playwright-specific strategies
- `optics_framework/engines/drivers/selenium.py` - Add CSS selector strategies
- `optics_framework/engines/drivers/appium.py` - Add Appium-specific strategies

## 4. Additional Image Detection Drivers

**Priority**: Medium | **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced

### Current State

Only two image detection models are available:
- **TemplateMatch** (OpenCV-based) - Local template matching
- **RemoteOIR** (Remote service) - Remote object image recognition

### Goal

Add more image detection/vision models to provide users with more options, better accuracy, and different use cases.

### Potential Additions

#### YOLO Integration

Object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) models:
- Real-time object detection
- Pre-trained models for UI elements
- Custom model support

**File to Create**: `optics_framework/engines/vision_models/image_models/yolo.py`

#### Cloud Vision Services

- **AWS Rekognition**: Amazon's image recognition service
- **Azure Computer Vision**: Microsoft's vision API
- **Google Cloud Vision**: Google's image analysis API (for object detection, not just OCR)

**Files to Create**:
- `optics_framework/engines/vision_models/image_models/aws_rekognition.py`
- `optics_framework/engines/vision_models/image_models/azure_vision.py`
- `optics_framework/engines/vision_models/image_models/google_vision_detection.py`

#### Deep Learning Models

- **TensorFlow/PyTorch Models**: Support for custom trained models
- Pre-trained models for UI element detection
- Model loading and inference

**File to Create**: `optics_framework/engines/vision_models/image_models/tensorflow_model.py`

#### Advanced OpenCV Algorithms

- **ORB** (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)
- **BRISK** (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints)
- **AKAZE** (Accelerated-KAZE)
- Feature matching alternatives to SIFT

### Implementation Guidelines

All image detection models must implement the `ImageInterface`:

```python
from optics_framework.common.image_interface import ImageInterface

class YourImageDetection(ImageInterface):
    def find_element(self, frame, element, index=0):
        # Implementation
        pass

    def element_exist(self, frame, element):
        # Implementation
        pass

## 5. Interactive Test Creation

**Priority**: Medium | **Difficulty**: Advanced

### Current State

Tests are created via CSV/YAML files or programmatically. There's no interactive test authoring tool, making it difficult for non-technical users to create tests.

### Goal

Support interactive test creation where users can:
- Record interactions automatically
- Visually select elements on screen
- Generate test steps automatically
- Edit tests in a visual interface
- Preview test execution step-by-step

### Key Features

#### Test Recorder

Record user interactions and generate test steps:
- Capture mouse clicks, keyboard input, scrolls
- Automatically detect element locators
- Generate test steps in CSV/YAML format
- Support for multiple strategies (XPath, text, image)

#### Visual Element Selector

Click on screen to select elements:
- Highlight elements on hover
- Show element information (XPath, text, attributes)
- Suggest multiple locator strategies
- Validate element locators

#### Test Editor

Visual editor for test cases:
- Drag-and-drop test step reordering
- Edit step parameters
- Add/remove test steps
- Preview test structure

#### Element Inspector

Inspect and validate element locators:
- Show all available locators for an element
- Test locator validity
- Suggest better locators
- Show element hierarchy

### Potential Implementation

- **Web-based UI**: React/Vue.js frontend with FastAPI backend

### Current State

Analysis reveals several areas with duplicate code and similar patterns that could be unified to reduce maintenance burden and improve code quality.

### Areas Identified

#### Driver Method Patterns

Similar implementations across Appium, Selenium, and Playwright:
- `press_element()`, `enter_text()`, `clear_text()`, `scroll()` have similar patterns
- Common error handling
- Similar event logging

**Files**:

- `optics_framework/engines/drivers/appium.py`
- `optics_framework/engines/drivers/selenium.py`
