# Architecture Overview

The Optics Framework is built on a modular, extensible architecture that enables vision-powered, self-healing test automation. This document provides a high-level overview of the framework's design, core principles, and component relationships.

## Design Principles

The framework follows several key design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Components are organized into clear, independent modules with well-defined interfaces
2. **Extensibility**: New drivers, element sources, and vision models can be added without modifying core code
3. **Resilience**: Built-in fallback mechanisms ensure tests continue even when primary methods fail
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between action execution, element detection, and vision processing
5. **Interface-Based Design**: Components communicate through well-defined interfaces, enabling easy substitution

## Level 1 – System Context

At the system level, the Optics Framework sits between test authors and external automation infrastructure.
It exposes multiple entry points (CLI, REST API, Python library) while orchestrating drivers, vision models, and device farms underneath.

    actorIntegrator["Framework Integrator or Tooling Engineer"]
    actorCi["CI or Orchestration System"]

    extAutomation["Automation Backends (Appium, Selenium, Playwright, BLE)"]
    extDevices["Real Devices or Device Farms"]
    extVision["Vision and OCR Services"]

    actorIntegrator --> systemOptics
    actorCi --> systemOptics

    systemOptics --> extAutomation
    systemOptics --> extDevices
    systemOptics --> extVision
```

## Level 2 – Containers and Layers

The rest of this document describes the Optics Framework's internal containers and layers (C4 Level 2), and how they collaborate at runtime.

The framework is organized into several key layers:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "User Interface Layer"
        CLI[CLI Commands]
        API[REST API]
        Library[Python Library]
    end

    subgraph "Core Layer"
        Optics[Optics Class]
        SessionMgr[SessionManager]
        Config[ConfigHandler]
    end

    subgraph "Builder Layer"
        Builder[OpticsBuilder]
        Factories[Factories]
    end

    subgraph "API Layer"
        ActionKW[ActionKeyword]
        AppMgmt[AppManagement]
        Verifier[Verifier]
        FlowCtrl[FlowControl]
    end

    subgraph "Strategy Layer"
        StrategyMgr[StrategyManager]
        Strategies[Location Strategies]
    end

    subgraph "Engine Layer"
        Drivers[Drivers]
        ElementSources[Element Sources]
        VisionModels[Vision Models]
    end

    subgraph "Execution Layer"
        ExecEngine[ExecutionEngine]
        TestRunner[TestRunner]
        EventSys[Event System]
    end

    CLI --> Optics
    API --> Optics
    Library --> Optics
    Optics --> SessionMgr
    SessionMgr --> Builder
    Builder --> Factories
    Factories --> Drivers
    Factories --> ElementSources
    Factories --> VisionModels
    Builder --> ActionKW
    Builder --> AppMgmt
    Builder --> Verifier
    Builder --> FlowCtrl
    ActionKW --> StrategyMgr
    StrategyMgr --> Strategies
    Strategies --> ElementSources
    Strategies --> VisionModels
    ExecEngine --> TestRunner
    TestRunner --> ActionKW
    TestRunner --> AppMgmt
    TestRunner --> Verifier
    TestRunner --> FlowCtrl
    ExecEngine --> EventSys
```

The layers have the following responsibilities and primary references:

- **User Interface Layer**:
  - Entry points for humans and tooling via CLI commands, the REST API, and the Python library.
  - Translates user intent into high-level operations without dealing directly with drivers or vision models.
  - See [CLI Layer](architecture/cli_layer.md) and [REST API Layer](architecture/api_layer.md).

- **Core Layer**:
  - Hosts the `Optics` facade, `SessionManager`, and `ConfigHandler`.
  - Owns configuration and session lifecycle, bridging interface-layer calls into the builder and execution pipeline.
  - See [Component Architecture](architecture/components.md) for core component details.

- **Builder Layer**:
  - Uses `OpticsBuilder` and factories to turn configuration into concrete driver, element source, and vision model instances.
  - Central place for dependency wiring and fallback chains between engines.
  - See [Component Architecture](architecture/components.md) and [Engines](architecture/engines.md).

- **API Layer**:
  - Provides high-level, user-facing keywords for actions, app management, verification, and flow control.
  - Encapsulates orchestration logic while delegating low-level work to strategies and engines.
  - See [Component Architecture](architecture/components.md) and [Strategies](architecture/strategies.md).

- **Strategy Layer**:
  - Implements self-healing location strategies that combine DOM, text, and image-based techniques.
  - Decides which element or vision strategy to apply and in what order.
  - See [Strategies](architecture/strategies.md) for details.

- **Engine Layer**:
  - Contains concrete automation backends (drivers), element sources, and vision models.
  - Talks to external systems such as Appium/Selenium/Playwright, device farms, and OCR/image services.
  - See [Engines](architecture/engines.md) for driver, element source, and vision model implementations.

- **Execution Layer**:
  - Coordinates test execution, result collection, and event publishing.
  - Provides runners and event infrastructure that drive API-layer keywords over time.
  - See [Execution](architecture/execution.md) and [Event System](architecture/event_system.md).

## Data Flow

### Session Creation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Optics
    participant SessionMgr
    participant Session
    participant Builder
    participant Factory

    User->>Optics: setup(config)
    Optics->>SessionMgr: create_session()
    SessionMgr->>Session: new Session()
    Session->>Builder: new OpticsBuilder()
    Builder->>Factory: get_driver(config)
    Factory->>Factory: discover & instantiate
    Factory-->>Builder: driver instance
    Builder-->>Session: configured builder
    Session-->>SessionMgr: session created
    SessionMgr-->>Optics: session_id
```

### Element Location Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ActionKW
    participant StrategyMgr
    participant Strategy
    participant ElementSource
    participant VisionModel

    ActionKW->>StrategyMgr: locate(element)
    StrategyMgr->>Strategy: try XPathStrategy
    Strategy->>ElementSource: locate(element)
    ElementSource-->>Strategy: result or None
    alt XPath fails
        StrategyMgr->>Strategy: try TextDetectionStrategy
        Strategy->>ElementSource: capture()
        ElementSource-->>Strategy: screenshot
        Strategy->>VisionModel: detect_text(screenshot)
        VisionModel-->>Strategy: text locations
    end
    Strategy-->>StrategyMgr: coordinates
    StrategyMgr-->>ActionKW: element location
```

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

These concerns cut across multiple layers and containers, and collectively shape the framework's runtime behavior and quality attributes.

### Self-Healing Mechanism

The framework implements self-healing through multiple layers:

1. **Strategy Fallback**: If one location strategy fails, try the next
2. **Driver Fallback**: If one driver fails, try the next configured driver
3. **Element Source Fallback**: If one element source fails, try the next
4. **Vision Model Fallback**: If one OCR/image model fails, try the next

This multi-layered approach ensures maximum test resilience.

### Configuration Structure

Configuration is hierarchical and supports:
- Multiple drivers with priority ordering
- Multiple element sources with fallback chains
- Multiple vision models for redundancy
- Per-component configuration options

### Extension Points

The framework is designed for easy extension:

1. **New Drivers**: Implement `DriverInterface` in `engines/drivers/`
2. **New Element Sources**: Implement `ElementSourceInterface` in `engines/elementsources/`
3. **New Vision Models**: Implement `ImageInterface` or `TextInterface` in `engines/vision_models/`
4. **New Strategies**: Extend `LocatorStrategy` in `common/strategies.py`
5. **New Keywords**: Add methods to API classes with `@keyword` decorator
